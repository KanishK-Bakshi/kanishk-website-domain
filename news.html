                    <p class="news-description">
                        I had the privilege of attending the "Residential Training Program on Low Carbon Pathways for Industrial Sectors," held at the Anil Agarwal Environment Training Institute (AAETI) in Nimli, Rajasthan, from July 02-05, 2024. This program focused on the need for industrial sectors to adopt low-carbon pathways to help India meet its 2030 carbon emission reduction target.
                    </p>
                    <p class="news-description">
                        The training program aimed to provide participants with the necessary knowledge and skills to enable industries, regulators, and professionals to meet their sustainability goals. The program covered critical decarbonization strategies, including circularity, resource efficiency, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), and adopting cleaner fuels.
                    </p>
                    <p class="news-description">
                        Topics discussed included the future of carbon capture, cleaner fuels like gas, biomass, and hydrogen, the role of circularity in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy-efficient technologies, and the role of renewable energy to reduce dependence on coal power. The course was particularly insightful for understanding sector-specific measures to reduce emissions and the potential of international and domestic climate finance for cleaner technologies.
